mcdb installation

  $ make PREFIX=
  $ make install PREFIX=
  $ make test

(Install defaults to under PREFIX=/usr/local if PREFIX= is not specified)

Using mcdb for nsswitch databases: (optional)

  $ mkdir /etc/mcdb
  $ nss_mcdbctl
  $ vi /etc/nsswitch.conf
      passwd: mcdb
      shadow: mcdb
      group: mcdb
      hosts: mcdb dns
      protocols: mcdb
      services: mcdb
      rpc: mcdb
      networks: mcdb
  # (save /etc/nsswitch.conf and test things out in another window)
  $ getent passwd root
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  $ getent group root
  root:x:0:root

On systems that can run both 32-bit and 64-bit executables, it is important
to install both 32-bit and 64-bit libnss_mcdb.so.2 libraries.  This is done
by default with 'make install', but if installing RPMs on a multilib system,
then two sets of RPMs need to be installed, e.g. mcdb-libs for x86_64 and i686.

Please note that changes to any databases require re-running nss_mcdbctl.
While I have been running the above configuration on my laptop for > 1 year,
nss_mcdbctl still needs to be run for changes made by other users to passwd,
shadow, and group databases.  Since I have not yet written pam code to be
triggered when those files are changed, you might leave
  shadow: files
if others might change passwords and you do not automate running nss_mcdbctl
so that password changes take effect immediately.

You may choose to disable nscd and test if performance increases.

Building an RPM
  ##(fill in correct version)
  $ version=0.03
  ##(set up RPM build environment, if not already configured)
  $ echo %_topdir $HOME/rpm >> $HOME/.rpmmacros
  $ cd $HOME && mkdir -p rpm/BUILD rpm/RPMS rpm/SOURCES rpm/SPECS rpm/SRPMS
  ##(begin with mcdb-$version.tar.gz) or create tarball from source
  $ rsync -avu --exclude=.git --delete /path/to/mcdb/ mcdb-$version
  $ tar cvzf mcdb-$version.tar.gz mcdb-$version
  $ rpmbuild -tb mcdb-$version.tar.gz
  ##(multilib platforms need both 32-bit and 64-bit mcdb-libs RPM for nss_mcdb)
  #$rpmbuild -tb mcdb-$version.tar.gz --target=i686
  #$rpmbuild -tb mcdb-$version.tar.gz --target=x86_64
  ##(RPM for binary install now located in rpm/RPMS/<arch>/mcdb-$version-*.rpm)
  $ rpm -Uvh rpm/RPMS/*/mcdb-$version-*.rpm
  ##(some clean up)
  $ rm -rf mcdb-$version
  $ rm -f mcdb-$version.tar.gz
