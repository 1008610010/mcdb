mcdb installation

  $ make
  $ make install
  $ make test


Using mcdb for nsswitch databases: (optional)

  $ mkdir /etc/mcdb
  $ nss_mcdbctl
  $ vi /etc/nsswitch.conf
      passwd: mcdb
      shadow: mcdb
      group: mcdb
      hosts: mcdb dns
      protocols: mcdb
      services: mcdb
      rpc: mcdb
      networks: mcdb
  # (save /etc/nsswitch.conf and test things out in another window)
  $ getent passwd root
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  $ getent group root
  root:x:0:root

Please note that changes to any databases require re-running nss_mcdbctl.
While I have been running the above configuration on my laptop for > 1 year,
nss_mcdbctl still needs to be run for changes made by other users to passwd,
shadow, and group databases.  Since I have not yet written pam code to be
triggered when those files are changed, you might leave
  shadow: files
if others might change passwords and you do not automate running nss_mcdbctl
so that password changes take effect immediately.

You may choose to disable nscd and test if performance increases.
