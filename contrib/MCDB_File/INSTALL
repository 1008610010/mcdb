You need Perl 5.005 or later.
You need mcdb installed on your system.  See https://github.com/gstrauss/mcdb/

1. Create a Makefile.

    perl Makefile.PL

2. Build the MCDB_File extension.

    make

3. Test it (please don't omit this step).

    make test

You should see some output and then:
Result: PASS

If any tests fail, please get in touch so we can sort out the problem.

4. Install the extension.

If you have built MCDB_File as a dynamic extension, it's as simple as
this.

    make install

If you have built MCDB_File as a static extension, follow the
instructions given during the build process.

5. If you have any problems, questions, or ideas for future
enhancements, please contact the author (see perldoc MCDB_File).
