contrib/README
--------------
This directory (contrib/) contains extension modules to various interpreters.
The extension modules attempt to provide mcdb interfaces to each interpreted
language in ways (paradigms) familiar to users of each language.

However, besides being just another Perl hacker, this coder's knowledge
of Python, Ruby, and Lua is limited, so please send questions, comments,
suggestions, and bug reports to:
https://github.com/gstrauss/mcdb/issues or email <code()gluelogic.com>

MCDB_File/      Perl   interface to create and read mcdb constant databases
lua-mcdb/       Lua    interface to create and read mcdb constant databases
python-mcdb/    Python interface to create and read mcdb constant databases
ruby-mcdb/      Ruby   interface to create and read mcdb constant databases

See */README in each package for more information, including installation info.
Packages require that mcdb be installed prior to running package install steps.
(To do otherwise requires minor changes to add -I, -L, -R rules to each build.)



Note to self:
probably should have named the extension modules with "mcdb-" prefix
(will probably rename if these are ever split to separate git repos)
