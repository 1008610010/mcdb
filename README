t/PERFORMANCE - performance notes

mcdb (mmap constant database) is originally based on the cdb package, a:
"fast, reliable, simple package for creating and reading constant databases."
mcdb is almost 33% faster, provides support for use in threaded programs, and
supports databases larger than 4 GB.

nss_mcdb is an nss implementation of standard authentication and netdb files
built as mcdb databases, which are faster than using nscd.
